00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,500
Participant : So you mentioned that you use some filters for to try to detect errors in geographical space somewhat

2
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:16,560
but you don't use somewhat the n random space so you could also look for some plausibility of some of the new samples

3
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,900
with a kind of ecological test looking at the habitat the niche

4
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,800
in Switzerland in at least with the floristic database

5
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:31,440
which is then providing the data to GBIF, they are at the moment that implementing a procedure

6
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,060
to use this as a plausibility test in addition to the geographic test
Leen Vandepitte :  okay

7
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,980
what I talked about the quality control procedures those are now in the OBIS database.

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:46,820
They're not yet available through the portal so

9
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:53,940
there's no way yet of taking into account the results of those queries on the portal they're working on that.

10
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:59,140
For the for the outliers,

11
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:08,280
they're using, it escapes me, they're using specific existing databases on salinity

12
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:11,600
and depth and some other things.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:18,040
They're looking at that, in combination with other things to decide :  decide according to

14
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,040
the outlier analysis if it is an outlier or not.

15
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,800
At the end of the presentation, I gave two references to publications.

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,000
One of them has a complete description of the quality control procedures

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:34,700
that we have implemented and all the information will be there.

18
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:40,480
Participant : that's typically an example where I think we could improve a lot of procedures with some

19
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:50,600
of these filters using the environment and look at find a sample for a species in a very unlikely environment

20
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,360
Leen Vandepitte :  Yeah 
Participant : you can also just warn the person say can you check

21
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:55,340
Leen Vandepitte :  Yes.
