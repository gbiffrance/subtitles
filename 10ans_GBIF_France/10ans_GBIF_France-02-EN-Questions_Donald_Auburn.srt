1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120
Participant : Donald, you have staring the meeting with BHL, Catalogue of life, can you said a world on that ?

2
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,980
Donald Auburn : A couple of things there : first and foremost I think our one of our biggest needs

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:23,780
is to finish the long long long task of compiling first a global

4
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:32,140
effectively complete, it will never be
fully complete, catalog of the names that loan organisms.

5
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:39,900
And secondly to work in a way that is achievable and credible to

6
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:48,920
construct and maintain a complete classification of life on Earth at the species level a working one, there will
be disagreements.

7
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:57,440
Catalog of life and activities such as Iply and zoobank and index fundgorom have been working

8
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:03,600
on parts of this and we've had umbrella activities where we've talked about the global names architecture etc.

9
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:09,860
I am in closed discussion with Catalogue of Life

10
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:17,960
about, as you're aware, about how we merge our activities better we treated this is something where

11
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:24,260
we're going to build all of these things separately and and hopefully all will come out of it with benefit.

12
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:29,880
GBIF shouldn't be doing anything to stitch
together names and classifications

13
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:35,040
that is separate from what the catalog of
life is doing or IOL is doing, we need to

14
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:45,500
combine those activities and we need to do so in a way that ensures that those who have put decades of effort into building their own databases

15
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,600
feel comfortable and feel that they get the credit they need

16
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,660
but we're nevertheless those datasets can be things that the global community can maintain the take forward

17
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:05,280
so I try to work through a workshop, organizing a workshop in the next few months with catalog of life and with others

18
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,120
looking at the sociology of how we do that,

19
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:12,360
and I think sociology is the
real issue technically it's easy and

20
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:17,780
then I think GBIF can provide a lot of
these supports for Catalog of Life to accelerate what we're doing.

21
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:27,140
More broadly, we have had discussions with BHL, Encyclopedia of life, Catalog of life, The bar code of life database and others

22
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,240
about how we start making real linkages
between out our data.

23
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:37,280
And again, part of the trouble is that we're all trying to duplicate bits of each other's activity

24
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,920
and I wanted to move towards an ecosystem where we have a shared understanding

25
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:47,840
of the graph of connections between specimens and collections

26
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:51,720
and tax on concepts and tax on names and publications and sequences and traits

27
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:57,480
at the very highest level and that instead of duplicating bits of that

28
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:03,340
we actually have interconnected infrastructure's so that there is one place

29
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:10,560
for finding all of the names of organisms so that we work together to populate BHL to the fullest extent possible.

30
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:18,180
So that GBIF can provide a service that locates the type specimen it's been digitized

31
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,600
and connect it up with the intellectual record and with the publication.

32
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,040
That's what we've got to go.

33
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:31,060
We're still with
infrastructure's that are offering value

34
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,740
but aren't part of the globally connected knowledge space I would like to see.

35
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:45,020
Anyone who can throw their weight into finding ways to make this happen and it's all about

36
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:52,300
solving project timelines and the sociology of how we give credit,

37
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:56,200
and how we recognize the expertise of contributors.

38
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,600
It's a complicated issue because about people

39
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:04,620
but if we get it right then I think we can provide a much better service

40
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:09,400
to the research community to text on the miss and others. Not in short time.
