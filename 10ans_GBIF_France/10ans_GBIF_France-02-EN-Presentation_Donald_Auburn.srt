00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:03,500
Donald Auburn : It's a great pleasure to be here today

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:12,340
France has always being one of the Core-stone participants in GBIF

3
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:19,540
a significant contributor to every part of our work and i'm very excited

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:27,220
to see that this event today and so many here to celebrate 10 years of GBIF France.

5
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:35,880
This presentation will touch on a few subjects there are many more things that could be talked about and I believe

6
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:41,700
many of them will be discussed at various points later in the day.

7
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:48,780
So GBIF is an international intergovernmental partnership

8
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:54,960
to mobilize biodiversity information for the widest possible good

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:01:00,440
primarily for research but ultimately also through research

10
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:08,320
to support sustainable development and other key decisions around the environment.

11
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:18,900
GBIF has a growing number of national participants and as I mentioned

12
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:23,980
France has been one of these from the very beginning and a key contributor

13
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:34,120
in the work of trying to engage with other 
countries particularly french-speaking countries in Africa and elsewhere.

14
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:44,660
After 15 years of GBIF existence as a an  international collaborative activity

15
00:01:45,220 --> 00:01:49,320
we can see that a significant number of

16
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:55,000
data records have been mobilized but perhaps even more clearly we can see that together,

17
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,820
we have much more work still to do.

18
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:07,560
If we think about Western Europe, North America, parts of Latin America, South Africa and australasia,

19
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:13,560
the volumes of data and the number of species represented in these datasets

20
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,920
is already very significant and a major outcome for

21
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,820
many institutions, many agencies and

22
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:33,340
many public groups sharing their data to
help us to put together a more complete picture.

23
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:40,660
But across much of Eastern Europe and Asia, North Africa and the Middle East especially,

24
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,700
and for many parts of the oceans,

25
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:47,160
the gaps are still very significant.

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,520
Nevertheless what we have been seeing year-by-year is

27
00:02:52,140 --> 00:03:01,160
that GBIF is an increasingly important tool for researchers in a wide range of fields.

28
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:07,860
Those who are studying particular species or particular taxonomic groups

29
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:14,880
as a source of information on specimens held in the world's collections

30
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:19,780
and other recorded data on the distribution of these species.

31
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:28,520
But also for many others who are trying to apply some genuine evidence of biodiversity patterns

32
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:35,160
as part of their decisions around agro-biodiversity, human health

33
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:40,740
conservation land planning and responses
to climate change.

34
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:50,420
I made what is certainly a very partial list of some of the many significant ways in which

35
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:57,960
France has been one of the core collaborators in this activity to this point.

36
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,640
France has been a stable and significant
contributor to GBIF,

37
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:13,700
financially and through the government structures ; a very large number of data points have been mobilized

38
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:21,460
by French institutions, support has been given to other countries in the hosting of their data

39
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:29,940
through physical infrastructure but also a massive amount of activity has been led by France

40
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,520
in supporting the development of capacity and skills,

41
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,920
not just in this country but around the world

42
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:46,900
France has been one of our most regular
contributors to activities for mentoring

43
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:53,040
the development of biodiversity information facilities in other parts of the world,

44
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:00,300
has led through the financing under the Sud Expert Plants program of

45
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:11,680
significant activity and has been reinforcing GBIF as an international activity

46
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:21,640
by providing much of the assistance for translation of key materials information resources training products into French.

47
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:30,380
And right now, within this room, Anne-Sophie and Philippe GrandColas are two of the the members of

48
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,740
our active members in our committee and governance structures

49
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:47,480
and others have been very active in task forces and contributing significant input the ideas that underpin GBIF.

50
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:53,360
As with all of our participants the result of this is that

51
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,240
work that's character it's been carried on here at the Museum and through your agencies and universities

52
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,700
and other collections and public groups around France has helped

53
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:12,740
to contribute to the wider picture for many many countries of the patterns of their biodiversity.

54
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,300
So I wanted to stand back from

55
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:25,500
just from some of the things we'll be talking about today,  just to say a few things about the
global picture

56
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,840
and what I think we're all trying to do together ;

57
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:36,620
some of the more recent developments in the tools and services and processes

58
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:43,400
that GFIF has been supporting and where I think we should be trying to go in the next five years.

59
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,240
So first of all, just to to summarize from my perspective what I think GBIF is,

60
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,380
I think GBIF has three overarching rolls

61
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:59,280
the first of these and the one that
underpins everything else

62
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:06,300
is to remove obstacles to collaboration and sharing and use of biodiversity data.

63
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,740
All around the world,

64
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:14,780
researchers, government, officers and others are seeking to access and maintain

65
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:20,900
information that relates to biodiversity and helps them with their work or their studies.

66
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:30,020
And yet it's very hard for them all to benefit from the knowledge, the expertise, the data that is being gathered in other places.

67
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:37,820
And more than anything else, and at all scales from institutions through countries to the global level,

68
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:42,180
our work is to try to ensure that this information flows freely

69
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:48,620
and that the barriers that stop individuals being able to access and understand

70
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,920
the limitations and the value of this
information are remove.

71
00:07:54,640 --> 00:08:04,840
Capacity-enhancement, training and basic improvements to underlying tools and software are key to this.

72
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:14,040
Secondly and the reason for which I think most people are currently aware of GBIF,

73
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:22,300
is as an organized evidence base for their recorded occurrence of species in time and space.

74
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:30,660
This is an important role trying to
ensure that whatever can degree of information we have

75
00:08:31,300 --> 00:08:38,600
that helps us to understand where species have occurred in the past, where they occur
now,

76
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:46,340
can be brought together whether that's from literature, from collections, from molecular work,

77
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:49,920
ultimately from remote sensing citizen science.

78
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:55,420
All of these are sources, all with their own bases, all with their own weaknesses

79
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,020
but we're together they can help us to understand these critical patterns.

80
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:07,080
And GBIF most visible output to date has been to bring these things together

81
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:16,420
and to create the data set of around 650 million specimens observations that we see today.

82
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:19,960
But thirdly and in my mind

83
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:30,440
still something of an incomplete task but right at the heart of GBIF was brought into existence

84
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:39,180
is to help Natural History collections to work together to provide the platform that
supports collection management

85
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,480
and taxonomic research for the 21st century and beyond.

86
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:49,460
My vision here is that we move further than

87
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,440
characterizing specimens as species locations and dates

88
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,140
and try to bring in the richer information that is

89
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:09,980
digitized and managed by many collections including imagery including links to sequences and tissue samples etc.

90
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:18,040
To do this in a way that facilitates a taxonomic researcher or someone else anywhere in the world

91
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:24,460
being able to find those materials and to be able to interact with them as far as possible

92
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:31,500
as they would if they were in the institution's concerned ; they're always going to be limits on this but

93
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:40,620
I believe that a global infrastructure for
biodiversity and collections data should be focusing on how we achieve this more effective.

94
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:47,840
And turning this around thinking about
the Intergovernmental landscape

95
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:53,800
GBIF has a critical role in underpinning

96
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:58,020
some of the work of the conventional biological diversity

97
00:10:58,760 --> 00:11:02,740
ipbes and the Group on Earth
Observations (GEO)

98
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:10,820
as a series of stacked layers trying to support governmental
activity globally

99
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:19,320
and through that, the kind of outcome seen in the IE targets and the sustainable development goals.

100
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:28,380
GBIF is the global source for
bringing together

101
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,680
data from throughout its network that can underpin modeling, biodiversity patterns

102
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:42,980
and therefore providing genuine evidence to underpin biodiversity just assessments and biodiversity commitments.

103
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,880
So a few things
that have been relatively recent advances in our network :

104
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:57,260
some of these seen incredibly dull but are actually much more significant

105
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,480
It's the dullest of
the all : data licenses.

106
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:09,420
At the time when GBIF was started 15 years ago, we didn't have creative commons licenses,

107
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:20,100
we relied on very specialized data
agreements with individual data publishers,

108
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,980
we left it open for any institution to include whatever terms he believed were necessary,

109
00:12:27,460 --> 00:12:34,440
for users of data and ultimately this had significant issues.

110
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:41,300
It meant that a researcher was technically obliged to read through vast quantities of metadata

111
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:47,100
to decide whether or not they were really authorized to use data for their purposes.

112
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:50,800
This does not scale the kind of levels of data we now have

113
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:59,380
and so we focused on trying to ensure
that every data record, every data set within the GBIF network

114
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:05,280
is associated with a data license that is as free and open as possible.

115
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:11,560
I'm pleased to say that after about a year of working with our data publishers we're now at the stage where

116
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,860
90% of the data sets have indeed been associated with the digital license

117
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:26,460
and more than 90% of those datasets
are associated now with licenses that require at most

118
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:31,020
the attribution of the data when we provide mechanisms to make that as simple as possible.

119
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:38,120
This is is dull but it's really a sign
of a big move

120
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:43,800
towards making these data part of a public data space where we can

121
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:47,200
discuss and improve and work on them together.

122
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:58,840
I think that this direction is one with that will really facilitate much more exploration and
manipulation of these data.

123
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,760
Connected with this, we've also been working hard to ensure that

124
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:09,140
we increase the visibility of the efforts of all of those who have contributed.

125
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,320
All datasets within GBIF are now associated with digital object identifier and

126
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:17,000
every time anybody download data from
GBIF,

127
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:24,740
they receive a digital object identifier for that download which connects back with all of the source data sets.

128
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:31,640
As a result of this, we now have the tools in place that if somebody publishes a research paper

129
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:35,980
based in part on data they have access to the GFIF network

130
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,320
they don't have to do anything more than cite that digital object identifier

131
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:45,120
and we can start making the
connections with all of the the datasets

132
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:51,380
which have contributed to that work which I hope will help to expose much more clearly

133
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,720
the value of our shared activity.

134
00:14:55,940 --> 00:15:00,820
GBIF historically has only focused on

135
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,920
presence data, evidence that a species

136
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:13,500
has been recorded in a place and then the links to the additional properties of the specimen or the observation
concerned.

137
00:15:14,660 --> 00:15:17,800
We are now able to incorporate

138
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:25,720
a richer subset of the data from many
ecological monitoring sampling activities

139
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:33,300
including some fences and
science where we get a better measure of

140
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:43,200
the methodology the co-occurrence of species and where possible the relative abundance of species in those samples.

141
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:50,280
This is still something for which
GBIF is at the beginning

142
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:57,080
and I do not expect that it's going to be easy for us to join all of these data together

143
00:15:57,720 --> 00:16:05,040
but there is significant value for us in having integrated access to these kinds of properties

144
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:10,620
because if nothing else it helps us to calibrate the significance of all of the other data

145
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:16,300
in terms of abundance of species in time and space.

146
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:26,320
We've been fortunate to receive from the
European Union significant funding over a 4 years period

147
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:34,400
to promote content mobilization and capacity enhancement particularly in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.

148
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:41,940
And we're just right now, in the first stage of
kicking off projects associated with this

149
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:52,160
with around 970 000€ being spent in the next two years on projects in African countries

150
00:16:52,480 --> 00:17:02,340
many of which have been supported in critical ways by GBIF France throught their capacity enhancement activities.

151
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:14,220
We look forward to this as a way to reinforce linkages especially with the future Sud expert plant to program.

152
00:17:16,520 --> 00:17:18,880
One last thing.

153
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,840
it's continuing and for which France has been involved

154
00:17:25,840 --> 00:17:31,100
is international collaboration
around tools and software.

155
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:38,720
The one specific example illustrated here and I believe we'll come back to this in other ways later,

156
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,460
is the reuse of tools developed by the Atlas of Living Australia (ALA)

157
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:48,680
in multiple countries and the contributions of those countries

158
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:56,060
including France, Spain, Scotland in this particular case here and others

159
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:01,040
in modifying these tools and making them more generally applicable.

160
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:08,640
I believe that this represents a real strengthening of the GFIF network as a way that many countries

161
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:14,400
can collaborate to ensure that national level stakeholders

162
00:18:14,920 --> 00:18:19,300
and in, I hope, in the future, regions such
as the Pacific and the Caribbean

163
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:28,140
can have tools that really enable their researchers to explore the data that relates to their biodiversity in an effective way.

164
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:36,440
Those are just a few of the things that I'm excited about as as recent changes and enhancements in our activity.

165
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:44,400
I just want to look very
briefly forward, GFIF operates in a five-year cycle

166
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:48,680
we're just coming towards the end of one
of these cycles and

167
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:54,960
from 2017 will be entering appeared with a new strategic plan, a new funding model

168
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:01,420
and really trying to take GBIF forward to
the next stage

169
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:09,060
and we've identified five strategic priorities for that period and I think these are ones where

170
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:18,420
we really need to support and promote and benefit from cooperation everywhere within the global network.

171
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,200
Just a couple of words on each of these first of all,

172
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,300
GBIF exists to ensure the free access to data everything we do

173
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:37,820
is about making sure that we're delivering the right kind of data to meet the needs of real users

174
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:44,020
we were engaged in lots of capacity enhancement actively engaged in lots of informatics activities

175
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,120
but those are not the justification for GBIF,

176
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,940
we're here to ensure that the data are delivered in the right form.

177
00:19:51,360 --> 00:20:00,120
So a growing part of our activities to communicate as clearly as we can with researchers

178
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:06,500
in different areas and domains and thematic focus points

179
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,700
to understand exactly what they are looking for in biodiversity data

180
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:17,040
to understand whether there are additional properties we need to be trying to mobilize,

181
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:24,360
how the metadata can be improved, which are the most critical gaps in data mobilization.

182
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,080
That should be targeted if we are to
support their needs.

183
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:39,420
Through this also to understand the kind of data products, data services that are most important to those researchers.

184
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:44,360
First and foremost : one of our priorities,

185
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,640
and some in this room have been involved in some of our task force's looking at this for different areas,

186
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,260
is to deliver relevant data.

187
00:20:54,480 --> 00:21:03,300
But under pending that, we need to be thinking about the ways in which our data need further attention.

188
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:07,820
One of the most critical of these is around data quality.

189
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:19,720
We have always taken the position that data quality is not an absolutely fitness for use for different users will vary widely

190
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:29,260
a specimen which represents the type for a species may not have a precise locality it may not have a precise date

191
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,060
but is still absolutely essential for many key purposes.

192
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:40,780
On the other hand, for other users, we need to be making sure that we have the finest possible precision

193
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:49,800
for time and space that we understand as clearly as possible the basis for the identification

194
00:21:50,060 --> 00:22:00,000
of the specimen and part of what we have to be doing together is to characterize the individual data records

195
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:06,760
and the global data set so
that we understand and communicate

196
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:14,480
exactly what it is : that is an offer and that we can work together to find ways to  improve it over time.

197
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:20,080
GBIF needs to address data gaps the most visible of these

198
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:25,320
are obviously the special ones because  we like to put points on maps

199
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,540
and then they will become clear and even the inconsistencies and

200
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:34,880
the underlying sources of data start to become really obvious.

201
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:40,140
Nevertheless we do have to put more
effort on

202
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:47,200
recognizing the areas where we most need to bring more data online.

203
00:22:47,820 --> 00:22:50,920
Right now, I would say that

204
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:55,680
GFIF has three priority areas that we have to focus on

205
00:22:55,740 --> 00:23:02,400
one is on those parts of the world where we have next no data at all, clearly

206
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:07,480
Russia, much of Eastern Europe, Asia,
North Africa and the Middle East

207
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:18,480
are very obvious and we're working and very enthusiastic about making better connections with data holders in regard to those regions

208
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:24,140
That's best way for us to think about the the geographic gaps.

209
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:29,240
For the taxonomic gaps i really believe that our focus should be

210
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,060
to be working even more closely with Natural History collections.

211
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:43,720
They will remain our best source for information on many species that are unlikely to be recorded in other ways.

212
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:50,700
We need to make sure that collections are well supported in the task of bringing all of those data online.

213
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:59,700
And thirdly, we need to be better focused on bringing in some of that sampling event date of the time series and indications of abundance

214
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:07,660
that help us to get more of a picture of a change
not only in space but also in time.

215
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:16,360
As we move into the next five-year period though I think we should be looked thinking even more at a fine scale about understanding

216
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:26,120
the places in which gaps in data discontinuities are particularly significant

217
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:31,540
for reducing the precision and effectiveness of analysis based on the data.

218
00:24:33,140 --> 00:24:36,960
Two other priorities underpinning all of this,

219
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:44,640
we need to be doing a better job than we have to this point of linking up out by the best information infrastructure's.

220
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:53,020
We rely heavily on the work of Species 2000 and the Catalog of Life and

221
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:58,080
more regional activities in organizing the names and classifications of species

222
00:24:58,340 --> 00:25:04,340
we want to do a better job of linking to the literature through the biodiversity heritage library and elsewhere

223
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:11,240
and to datasets on traits and sequences and other environmental attributes.

224
00:25:11,660 --> 00:25:20,660
GBIF has to work closely with other research infrastructures and has to make sure that is well embedded  in geospatial data management.

225
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:30,200
This remains a big and significant challenge and one where things like the data licenses

226
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:36,320
and the digital object identifier a key to us taking a lead in these areas.

227
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:46,120
And lastly, I'm bring this right back full circle : we do need to continue to work to empower our global network

228
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:54,640
the curious diagrams are put up represent some of the models we've been trying to put in place to help

229
00:25:54,840 --> 00:26:00,780
those who are supporting GBIF nodes and national biodiversity information facilities.

230
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:08,800
More of a roadmap set of guidance under which we can then provide better training tools and support

231
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:16,740
for focusing on how on the national level we deal with data mobilization,

232
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:24,220
supporting data users, improving data quality and strengthening the network that is at the heart of this

233
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:32,240
Most of our activity, one way or another, is targeted at supporting our global network

234
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:39,500
and doing that is not something that we can do purely as a centrally driven centrally funded thing.

235
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:49,580
It really depends on people in this room and in similar situations around the world or collaborating with a shared vision.

236
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,860
So I want to thank you again , thank you for this opportunity

237
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:56,100
I'm very pleased to be here.

238
00:26:56,400 --> 00:27:06,580
I'm very pleased at having France such a key member in our network and I wish you a very successful day.

239
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,460
Thank you. *cheering*
