1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,940
Leen Vandepitte : My name is Leen Vandepitte,  I'm from the Flanders Marine Institute in Oostende, Belgium

2
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:12,660
and I'm the data manager for the European node of OBIS which is the Ocean Biogeographic Information System

3
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:17,680
and link to that I'm also involved in the world register of marine species.

4
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:23,940
Okay, what i will do is ; Anne-sophie has asked me me to talk about EurOBIS

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,119
and how is links to GBIF, so that's what I'll do.

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:30,880
I'll sketch a little bit what EurOBIS is,
the history about EurOBIS,

7
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,160
how is it linked to other initiatives for example OBIS,

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:38,040
and then how OBIS and GBIF fit together.

9
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:50,520
About 15 to 20 years ago if we would look in Belgium to a biological data, then we would know that it's very scattered

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:56,160
Everyone has a little data set somewhere but there's no way everything gets together

11
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:01,140
and biological data were also collected with very confined boundaries

12
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:06,020
and you're sense that if you would have or if you would do research on a project or PhD

13
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:10,920
you have your time frame of three to five years so your data is limited in time

14
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:19,120
it would also be limited in space because mostly you stick to one region for your PhD or your sampling

15
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:22,680
and you would also have

16
00:01:23,020 --> 00:01:28,560
financial limitations because you have to take into account the budget that you have to do your sampling.

17
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:38,320
What happens is this isn't only the case in Belgium but it's all over Europe and even all over the world

18
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:45,880
and the similar thing that happens everywhere is that data get collected data get analized people publish on their data

19
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:50,380
and then they classify their data somewhere which is mostly on a CD

20
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,540
and a closet somewhere and after a while you just forget about the fact that you have them

21
00:01:55,760 --> 00:02:00,600
and on top of that everybody is working on its own specific dematic group

22
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:04,840
people are working on male bentos you have people working on fish on macro bentos,

23
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,600
so it's very very diverse.

24
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:12,160
So if you look at all that then you kinda cannot help but wondering

25
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:18,500
how can we see the large-scale global patterns and all this if the data is so scattered everywhere ?

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,320
And the answer to that basically lies in bringing your data together.

27
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:33,920
GBIF does that but with in Belgium we have EurObus European Obus node,  which brought European marine data together.

28
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:41,080
And this all started with in the malabif project with which was a project on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning

29
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,700
specifically for the marine environment.

30
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:49,580
And after that EuroBIS was continued in several other projects

31
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,880
and, I'm not sure how many people here are familiar with marine research or the marine landscape,

32
00:02:56,180 --> 00:03:00,880
but two very important projects here are imminent biology which

33
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,280
is funded by the European government and also Lifewatch which has been mentioned earlier today.

34
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:14,520
So if we look at EurOBIS, the original focus there was to have your taxons  distribution information in space and time.

35
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:19,180
So basically what is where at what time that's what we were looking at.

36
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:24,980
It started in 2004 so it's more than 10 years already that we're working on it

37
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,220
and in that time it has evolved in a sense that we're now

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,280
recently extended the database to also be able to deal with

39
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:37,820
measurement or facts which is basically biomass information.

40
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:44,600
Fish lengths for example, stomach analysis data of birds or fish, and so on.

41
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:50,500
And also a link with abiotic information because mostly when you collect biological sample

42
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:57,160
you also measure sediments,  the composition of the sediment temperature salinity and so on.

43
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,100
So all that can now be stored all together within the database.

44
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:05,080
Now the aims of EurOBIS were pretty simple,

45
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:09,640
it'll be aimed to be a one access point for all that data.

46
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,860
Easy access and free access, open access.

47
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,780
No passwords, no limitations on getting access to the data.

48
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,800
And the second aim, of course, is if you bring together all that scattered information is to be able to

49
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:31,460
help scientists to increase the understanding of the distribution and biodiversity, of the European marine life.

50
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:36,140
Next to that it also helps and identifying gaps in our knowledge

51
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:43,280
if we would have specific region that is uncovered for data then we know we have a gap and we should look into that.

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,660
And lastly, and that's very important for us, is

53
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:54,440
we try to give an indication of the fitness for use of the data of an indication on the quality

54
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,420
and the completeness of the data, and I'll get back to that in a minute.

55
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:04,000
First the database itself : it's an SQL database basically,

56
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:09,780
which is completely compatible with Darwin Core which is used by GBIF and IPT also.

57
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:15,940
It has metadata information we also have a system where we can assign DOIs on a data set level.

58
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:25,340
So DOI basically gives you an easy way of citing a data set when it is used and you can also keep track of the citations.

59
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,020
It has a current information and measurement or facts information.

60
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,720
The content,  I just looked at it earlier this week,

61
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:40,160
we almost have 700 data sets from a little bit more than 150 Institutes within Europe

62
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:44,280
There's twenty point seven million distribution records in there

63
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:47,920
and 5.5 million measurement or facts values

64
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:52,460
which are mostly biomass and abundance information.

65
00:05:52,780 --> 00:06:00,360
And if you look at the species names in there, there's more than 63,000 species names that have been documented so far.

66
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,360
Forty-one percent of them are accepted species names,

67
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,220
but I'll get back to that later on because

68
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:14,340
lots of times, we get older data sets that use names that are now seen as a synonym of the accepted name's,

69
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:18,480
so that's why we have a large number of species names.

70
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:26,560
Just to give you an ID on the growth :  so we have the distribution records and the number of data sets.

71
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:33,700
It all started in early 2000s and it keeps on growing basically.

72
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:44,260
Now, EurOBIS as a database is really nice for us the European level we've been able to do a lot of work with European projects and so on.

73
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:54,020
But of course it's only a database and its value can become a lot bigger if it can be linked to one or two similar initiatives

74
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,420
so it's part of a bigger picture and this is really important.

75
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:04,740
So EurOBIS itself gets its data from several providers,

76
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:09,680
I'm listing a few of them there but the most important one right now are

77
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:17,680
the small scale and the short term data sets that people collect in the framework of PhD small research projects

78
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:26,100
And secondly the national monitoring data : each country has normally a monitoring program and what we've tried to do over the last year's

79
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,920
is to get access to those marine monitoring data to make them available.

80
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:40,280
We're takin data in several ways we're not picky on how people provide their data to us.

81
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,860
The easiest system for us is IPT.

82
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:49,480
Some data systems like Isis have their own web services so we can rides those.

83
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,100
We collaborate with SeaDataNet which is also a marine project.

84
00:07:55,260 --> 00:08:04,980
We just basically also accept text files, Excel files, Access files, anything that contains information on a distribution of species.

85
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:11,420
we are willing to deal with that and format it so it fits into the database.

86
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:20,420
What we do : the data collection happens continuously but once a month we do an upload into the database and then data become available.

87
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:29,360
Data available within EurOBIS can be consulted through several ways the one on the left is

88
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:39,120
the EurOBIS data portal so that basically gives you an overview of data sets that we have and you can query it based on a species name for example.

89
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,000
The second one is the amount net biology portal is more sophisticated

90
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:52,180
because you can combine specific species traits with species names or species groups.

91
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,840
And then the third one is LifeWatch.

92
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:01,120
Which is not really a portal where you go to but delivers web services.

93
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:07,360
So there's ways of combining several web services to to get information for you.

94
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:14,620
So I really invite you to have a look at those portals and see what is available, see what is accessible,

95
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,840
it would take me too much time to go through them.

96
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,820
So EurOBIS, part of the bigger picture : it gets his information bottom up.

97
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:30,680
but it also provides its information to OBIS which is the international level, basically.

98
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:38,120
And OBIS, as you can see on the map, covers worldwide all the marine and seas and oceans

99
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,280
And OBIS itself doesn't only get its data from EurOBIS but gets it from a whole network of notes, all these nodes.

100
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:50,040
Those can either be regional like the

101
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:53,280
Does that work ? Okay.

102
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,220
So it can be reached now basically, for example USA, the African ones ;  it can be thematic;

103
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:09,720
OBIS map for example focuses on distribution information from marine mammals and sea turtles so you can find information there

104
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:16,080
And there's also smaller regions in this case for example MedOBIS and Black Sea OBIS.

105
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:24,560
So in total, there's 29 nodes that supply information to OBIS that help it grow

106
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,020
Each of those nodes is, again, depending on the whole network of local providers

107
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:37,860
so just the same as EurOBIS like, we gather data from european institutes and researchers ; the same goes for all the other nodes

108
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:50,240
That way OBIS being the agregator of all the information,  it can build a global alliance and set up a collaboration with scientific communities.

109
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:55,280
This really helps in getting free and open access by geographic data.

110
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:59,180
OBIS itself also has a data portal,

111
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:06,040
that's the link they just recently launched a renewed portal so it's still on beta

112
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:14,100
but again, we kindly invite everyone to have a look and even if you have any feedback or comments on the on the website itself,

113
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:16,980
you're more than welcome to to let us know.

114
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:21,940
What you can do, on the OBIS portal, again there are several options

115
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:28,800
to query the data and to get to statistics so you can group or you can look for data sets per country or Institute

116
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:35,220
per marine, world heritage site for example and based on what you ask for, you get

117
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:42,520
different results if you look for example at the data sets you get an overview of where is it coming, from how can you cite it,

118
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,180
what's the background on the data set what kind of data is in there  and so on.

119
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:58,540
Nice to know or good to know is that OBIS and EurOBIS are basically in the same building at Oostende.

120
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:03,660
It's two different Institute's that host OBIS and EurOBIS but we're in the same building ;

121
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:08,600
so being next door to each other really gives us opportunities to work closely together

122
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,280
One of those opportunities that we took is to start

123
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:21,080
developing quality control tools to be able to assess both the quality and the fitness of the data that we have in the data systems.

124
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,340
I'll just explain a little bit more about that.

125
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:31,700
So the aim of these quality control procedures is of course to help providers and data managers.

126
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:37,800
Because we check the quality, we check the completeness, we try to detect possible errors.

127
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:43,160
And on all those levels we give feedback to our original providers, so they are able to

128
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:47,680
if it would be a mistake to correct the data and to resend it to us.

129
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:53,560
What we do is we basically assign a quality flag to each available records.

130
00:12:54,360 --> 00:13:00,540
But important here is to realize that we're not saying a record is good or bad,

131
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:06,400
we're just giving an indication of the fitness for purpose and the fitness for use.

132
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:14,300
By assigning those flags, we are helping people to filter out specific records with a certain quality standards.

133
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:22,760
I'll just give an example : one record could be "abra alba" which is  a tiny shell I have a picture there

134
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:27,380
and you know the latitude and longitude and you know what year and has been collected in.

135
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:30,040
What can you do with that record ?

136
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:36,740
It's a record that is perfectly suitable for a general distribution analysis because it's a species occurrence.

137
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,060
It's also suitable for a temporal analysis if you'd only look at the year,

138
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,760
because you know which year it was sample then but

139
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:49,240
it's not suitable for seasonal analysis because you're missing the day and the month.

140
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:53,040
It's not because you're missing the day and the month that you cannot do anything with it,

141
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,700
that's what we try to do, by assigning those quality flags,

142
00:13:55,800 --> 00:14:00,720
it's to still give you an indication of what it can and cannot be used for.

143
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:09,800
It will also not be suitable for abundance analysis because you only know it is present you don't know how many they found in what region.

144
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,600
Okay.

145
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:14,000
How are we doing this ?

146
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,600
These quality control procedures in two ways :

147
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:22,220
we have an automated process which is running on the OBIS database

148
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:30,600
which assigns those quality flags to each individual record and which helps us to give feedback to all our providers.

149
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,300
Just to give you some background : it involves 28 different checks

150
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:47,160
subdivided in five big degrees being : taxonomy, geography, completeness of the records, the format of the data and information on outliers.

151
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:53,880
The second thing that we do is we offer a number of those quality checks as online web services,

152
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:58,880
which means that you as a researcher, can take your data set to the web services,

153
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:06,740
run it through it and get the results and then if there would be inconsistencies or errors, you can immediately correct your own data.

154
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:12,260
For LifeWatch that would be the URL where you can go to,

155
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:16,600
so it's on www.lifewatch.be and there's a section on data services (www.lifewatch.be/data-services)

156
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:21,980
and there's two that might be very relevant for some of you :

157
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:25,200
as the first one, as a very basic one, is show on map,

158
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,920
you just upload your lat(itude) and long(itude) and you put them on a map to

159
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:35,200
immediately visually check if all the coordinates or all the sampling locations are where you expect them to be.

160
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:45,700
The second one is a taxon match which means that you map your taxon names with existing standard registers.

161
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,740
For example : because we're in marine institutes, we have worms in there,

162
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:53,400
so you check your name against the world which there are marine species

163
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:58,680
but we're also offering non-marine registers ;  for example catalog of life is in there.

164
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:06,160
PESI is in there, which is a pan-european infrastructure that has marine and murmuring names.

165
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,040
There's plenty more still coming.

166
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:19,240
Just to give you an idea on the importance of the quality control procedures, a very basic one one is a taxonomic quality control,

167
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,000
so what you see on the left, is the number of species names and the number of rare species

168
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:30,180
that were counted when several data sets were combined into one.

169
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:39,320
Left as before it, so it's before quality control so just looking for example, for the Mediterranean, we had eleven hundred and twenty species names there

170
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:47,160
Now after a quality control so really checking is each name spelled correctly is the synonym already accepted name.

171
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,560
We reduce the number of species to a little bit over eight hundred.

172
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:58,920
So this really shows that your quality control on your taxonomic or on your taxonomy is really important.

173
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:09,900
It's highly needed especially, not necessarily if you're working on your own data set but if you start combining things then it really becomes important,

174
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:16,380
because if you don't do a check on your taxonomy and you have a spelling mistake or a name no longer in use,

175
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:23,900
then you still see that as a specious and you get a higher biodiversity range in the area that you're looking at

176
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:26,520
compared to what it actually is.

177
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:33,600
What we do for the marine datasets is just much with WoRMS

178
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,400
and if we do that much for EurOBIS and OBIS,

179
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:40,260
we keep track of the unique identifier

180
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,400
within WoRMS for each issues names.

181
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,020
Because OBIS and WoRMS are linked,

182
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:49,820
that means that if you have a synonym and an accepted name in OBIS,

183
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:52,400
both pointing to the same species

184
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:59,020
through the link with WoRMS if you query on either of those names, you get the records for both names

185
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,120
because the system knows this is basically the same so it brings things together.

186
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:09,160
A second check like I mentioned : the geographic quality check,

187
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:15,500
also very simple things that we're looking at so your latitude longitude needs to be different from 0;0.

188
00:18:15,900 --> 00:18:21,360
If you plot that even an OBIS still, as 0-0 a hotspot on biodiversity on the map,

189
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:29,340
it's right off the coast of West Africa so it's still marine but it's incorrect in most cases that's what we know.

190
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:35,020
We also make sure that the latitude and longitude are between the 90s and 180s

191
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:41,080
because we know when you transfer for example from text to excel, weird things can happen with dots and commas

192
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,920
so that's a check that we do and since we are dealing with marine data

193
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,920
of course we are looking at

194
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:53,700
whether the points are actually in the sea or in an ocean

195
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:58,660
we do take into account a 20-kilometre buffer because we know that

196
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:03,480
not everybody documents his coordinates as precise.

197
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:09,080
We also have coastal datasets so we want to avoid that we

198
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,740
tag the coastal ones as being possibly incorrect.

199
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,080
Just an example :

200
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:24,700
this is an actual data set that we received so sightings and strandings of marine turtles, the UK and Ireland

201
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:29,900
Just looking at the map makes you know that something is wrong.

202
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,900
it's basically a very simple error it's a switching of the

203
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:40,140
no it's actually here a missing minus sign because we're working in decimal degrees.

204
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,860
What also happens very often is the switching of latitude and longitude, the columns get switched.

205
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:51,940
So mapping or using a visualization of your coordinates can really help you to

206
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:56,500
very fastly identify errors like this and very easily correct them .

207
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:09,280
What we do specifically on OBIS,  and this might relate a little bit to the to the previous talk on outliers or records that get  thrown out of specific analysis,

208
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:14,020
so what we do on the level of OBIS is we look for geographic outliers.

209
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,660
Geographic outliers within a data set.

210
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:22,460
I'll just show you an example also.

211
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,700
This is an ICES data set that we received

212
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,500
and it looks a bit strange it could be correct but at first look you think

213
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:35,280
the dots in Africa are certainly going to be an error.

214
00:20:36,060 --> 00:20:37,140
That is like that.

215
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:42,600
But the second thing that you see is that you have a lot of points in the north and you have a lot of points in the south,

216
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,440
it might be okay but you're not quite sure.

217
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:52,160
First back to the dots on on lands : those are picked up

218
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:59,640
first of all by the geographic check, where we just plot the species and look at the 20-kilometer boundary of the coastline

219
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:03,100
and they also show up in the outliner analysis,

220
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:08,040
you just know they're they're wrong you have to you have to go back to your provider and check this.

221
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:11,680
But for the second batch, the ones in in orange,

222
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,860
they are okay because they're in the sea.

223
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,160
They're not on land so we're not sure,

224
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:23,420
but if we do this outlier analysis then

225
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:32,540
those still come out as possibly being incorrect because it doesn't quite match with the philosophy that's behind the outlier analysis.

226
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:36,260
What we do in cases like this is we go back to our provider .

227
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:41,260
What we saw indeed is when we talked to the provider

228
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:45,740
the land dots were definitely an error so those are corrected

229
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:52,480
and the Antarctic locations were also incorrect something went wrong while they were documenting the latitude and longitude

230
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:58,340
while the ones in the north are correct and they just showed up in the outlier analysis

231
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,880
because it's a bit of a sampling bias that happened within that data set.

232
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:09,060
These out Larry analysis can really help you getting a good feel of the data that you have available

233
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:13,400
and can help you a little bit better in deciding whether you should keep

234
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:18,340
certain records or whether you should discard them if you're doing an analysis.

235
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:26,900
Just the last example on the outliers : so the previous one was really within a data set just looking at the sampling locations.

236
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:34,160
What we also do on the level of OBIS is looking at environmental outliers on species level

237
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:38,660
So OBIS has all those databases or all those data sets put together

238
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:41,440
and the system goes through its species by species

239
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:46,860
and it combines all the observations of all the different data sets for one particular species

240
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:49,480
and then it doesn't outlier analysis on that.

241
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:51,320
It takes several things into account :

242
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:56,180
it takes into account geography depth, salinity and temperature.

243
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:59,260
And again the same thing as on the previous map :

244
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:02,660
so on the left it's looking at geography and

245
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:05,740
on the right it's looking at depth.

246
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:15,180
You see differences in the outlier analysis for geography something might be okay while for depth it might show up as a possible outlier.

247
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:18,820
Those are the ones that you want to look at in more detail.

248
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:22,820
So again we have done that, we have consulted

249
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:29,560
with literature with experts and with available ecological information

250
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:33,760
and that did show that the dots in the north are okay

251
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:40,240
while the dots in the Mediterranean Sea was actually a misidentification of that specific species

252
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:47,840
So again, here, outlier analysis can help you in deciding whether you want to keep a record or discard it.

253
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:52,760
Now OBIS data is very widely used

254
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,320
so is the GBIF data which was mentioned earlier,

255
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:59,960
so there are several publications that cite OBIS

256
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:04,840
there are several ways that people use the portal to explore OBIS to see what is in there.

257
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,520
For example for France you can just go to the portal and

258
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:14,940
get an overview of all the marine datasets from France that are currently available within the system.

259
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:21,800
If we then click through to a specific data set you get an overview of all the metadata

260
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:28,320
and here, on the right you also get an indication of the data quality, very basic.

261
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:33,380
Are we talking species or not ? Is a time indication there ? And so on.

262
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:39,860
So again an invitation to go to the portal yourself and see what it can do.

263
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,620
Now OBIS and GBIF : how do they relate ?

264
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,640
Because this is basically where we want to get to.

265
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:56,000
Just a summary again : so we have OBIS which is fed data through its different nodes : regional and thematic.

266
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:59,860
Basically GBIF has a very similar approach,

267
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:07,500
of how it works : with the bi-level biodiversity information facilities : the GBIF and the nodes. It's the same way.

268
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:16,080
So what happens in 2014 : an agreement was signed between OBIS and GBIF.

269
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:24,640
The agreement, very briefly, says that OBIS and GBIF are complementary initiatives with common goals.

270
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:27,320
It makes sense to work together.

271
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:36,080
And what they try to do or what we will try to do is work towards a maximizing of quantity quality completeness fitness for use

272
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:41,280
of all those marine biodiversity datasets that are accessible through both initiatives

273
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:47,960
Now this is on the,  what I like to call the fuzzy above us, OBIS and GBIF level,

274
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:57,080
but how does this translate to actually the nodes and what we can really do to share data is like this :

275
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:00,060
where will I start.

276
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:05,480
Okay, what has happened last year, is on the level of OBIS and GBIF.

277
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:11,720
GBIF has given OBIS a list of all it's available datasets, per country,

278
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:16,460
with an indication of the number  of species that are marine.

279
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:21,800
GBIF has used WoRMS to match all the species and to filter out the marine ones

280
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:30,100
Now OBIShas an overview of datasets that are 100-percent marine or for example 75% marine.

281
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:34,620
Those are the ones that we would like to focus on if we don't already have them.

282
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,600
So what will happen in practice is that the OBIS nodes,

283
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:45,980
at that level OBIS's nodes will start contacting GBIF nodes to see if

284
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:51,860
marine data sets from GBIF's nodes can feed into the OBIS node's

285
00:26:52,720 --> 00:27:02,480
Then from the different OBIS nodes,  it will fit to OBIS ; so OBIS aiming for a complete overview of all marine datasets worldwide.

286
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:09,400
The whole thing or that the whole setup is to really encourage collaboration between

287
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:13,420
the OBIS nodes and the GBIF nodes because again we have the same goal :

288
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:18,280
OBIS is focusing on the marine environment, GBIF is focusing on all environments

289
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:23,480
but there can really still be in exchange because I'm betting that GBIF France has different contacts

290
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,820
within the country then we have from

291
00:27:25,820 --> 00:27:30,520
EurOBIS so we can learn from each other we can really move things forward.

292
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:40,240
And important there is we already all have a lot of work so if we can avoid duplication of effort I think that's very welcome,

293
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:46,680
so we really should see who does what and how we can divide work and go from there.

294
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,700
Final slides : where to go to from now ?

295
00:27:53,960 --> 00:28:03,100
What I've done this week is very quickly have a look at EurOBIS and see which data sets from France are already available, marine ones.

296
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:08,360
There more than the ones that I've listed here but those were the ones that really caught my eye,

297
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:16,800
my eye so we already have data from Ifremer, from IRD, from the museum here, from Observatoire océanologique.

298
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:23,500
There's already a lot of things moving but I'm guessing that there's still a lot more that can be shared.

299
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:26,380
I should really look into that.

300
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:29,440
So again, the future steps is that

301
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:35,760
the OBIS nodes will look at that list of GBIF datasets with marine species

302
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:42,000
per country and then the responsible nodes will contact the responsible GBIF nodes

303
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:44,460
to see how we can work together.

304
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:51,700
And again stressing it's a two-way data exchange we really want to avoid a duplication of effort.

00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:57,180
That having set, from an EurOBIS point of view, I'm really looking forward to

306
00:28:57,680 --> 00:29:02,300
have a talk with GBIF France and see how we can start this collaboration.

307
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:09,240
It's a long process, it always is it's a continuous thing but it might be good to establish first contact here and

308
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,040
see where we can go from there.

309
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:16,540
So thank you very much and I don't know if they're time for questions.
